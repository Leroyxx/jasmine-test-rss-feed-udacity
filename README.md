# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I came in.


## How to run my solution

Get the files (e.g - clone this repo by opening git bash, `cd`ing to where you want the files and running `git clone https://github.com/Leroyxx/jasmine-test-rss-feed-udacity.git`) and open `index.html` with a web browser. The tests will start running in the browser and show up on the bottom of the page.

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.
